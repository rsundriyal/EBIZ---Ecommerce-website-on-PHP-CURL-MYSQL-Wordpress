Did you know that as many as 3% of internet users have cookies disabled? Some of them are not even aware of it.

WooCommerce requires cookies enabled in order to add products to the cart and complete checkout. If your visitors have cookies disbled, they won't be able to make purchases in your store.

The problem is that WooCommerce does not display any kind of information when someone with cookies disabled try to add a product to the cart, it simply does not work (either it fails without error message or brings the user to the cart and says the cart it's empty).

<strong>Finally there is an easy way to encurage users to enable cookies. SIP Cookie Check for WooCommerce is here to help.</strong>
